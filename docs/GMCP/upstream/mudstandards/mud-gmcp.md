# Generic MUD Communication Protocol (GMCP)

**Source**: [Mudhalla](https://tintin.mudhalla.net/protocols/gmcp/)

MUD servers often want to send additional data to a MUD client that doesn't necessarily need to be displayed, as well as needing a way to identify clients that support out-of-band data.

The history of GMCP starts with the [Achaea Telnet Client Protocol (ATCP)](/ATCP_Specification) using TELNET code 200 which was implemented by cMUD in 2008. ATCP however only allowed for sending plain text. MSDP (Mud Server Data Protocol) was developed in 2009 and provides a standardized way to define typeless variables, arrays, tables, and commands. In 2010 IRE launched mudstandards.org in an attempt to update the ATCP protocol with input from the wider MUD community.

This resulted in the conceptualization of ATCP2 using TELNET code 201, which was later renamed to GMCP. GMCP uses the JSON syntax to define structured and typed data.

At some point mudstandards announced they were unhappy with the community effort and would privately develop GMCP with CMUD, where GMCP support and an interface would be hardwired into CMUD. In response Aardwolf MUD went ahead and implemented GMCP independently, and TinTin++ and MUSHclient provided working interface scripts for Aardwolf a few weeks later. The out-of-the-box CMUD interface never materialized.

As (the original) mudstandards.org became defunct in 2011 this document provides a brief technical description of the GMCP protocol as well as MSDP over GMCP. MSDP over GMCP intends to provide MSDP capable MUD servers a means to communicate with clients that only support GMCP, leveraging their existing MSDP implementation. Servers that implement MSDP over GMCP will be able to use both the MSDP and JSON standard for defining structured data as well as perform MSDP event handling in either format.

## The GMCP Protocol

GMCP is implemented as a Telnet option RFC854, RFC855. The server and client negotiate the use of GMCP as they would any other telnet option. Once agreement has been reached on the use of the option, option sub-negotiation is used to exchange information between the server and client.

### Server Commands

``` text
IAC WILL GMCP    Indicates the server wants to enable GMCP.
IAC WONT GMCP    Indicates the server wants to disable GMCP.
```

### Client Commands

``` text
IAC DO   GMCP    Indicates the client accepts GMCP sub-negotiations.
IAC DONT GMCP    Indicates the client refuses GMCP sub-negotiations.
```

### Handshake

When a client connects to a GMCP enabled server the server should send IAC WILL GMCP. The client should respond with either IAC DO GMCP or IAC DONT GMCP. Once the server receives IAC DO GMCP both the client and the server can send GMCP sub-negotiations.

The client should never initiate a negotiation, if this happens however the server should abide by the state change. To avoid infinite loops the server should not respond to negotiations from the client, unless it correctly implements the Q method in RFC 1143.

### Disabling GMCP

When a typical MUD server performs a copyover it loses all previously exchanged GMCP data. If this is the case, before the actual copyover, the MUD server should send IAC WONT GMCP, the client in turn should fully disable GMCP. After the copyover has finished the server and client behave as if the client has just connected, so the server should send IAC WILL GMCP.

When a typical MUD client loses its link and reconnects it loses all previously exchanged GMCP data. The server should reset its GMCP state and re-negotiate GMCP whenever a client reconnects.

### GMCP definitions

``` text
GMCP             201
```

### Example MSDP over GMCP handshake

``` text
server - IAC WILL GMCP

client - IAC   DO GMCP

client - IAC   SB GMCP 'MSDP {"LIST" : "COMMANDS"}' IAC SE

server - IAC   SB GMCP 'MSDP {"COMMANDS" : ["LIST", "REPORT", "RESET", "SEND", "UNREPORT"]}' IAC SE
```

The single quote characters mean that the encased text is a string, the single quotes themselves should not be send.

## Data Format

Each GMCP data exchange should use the `IAC SB GMCP <package.subpackage.command> <data> IAC SE` format.

The package name can be case insensitive.

The `<data>` field is optional and should be separated from the package field with a space. When sending a command without a data section the space should be omitted. The data field must use the JSON data syntax with keywords being case sensitive using UTF-8 encoding.

## Packages

Each MUD server is expected to define and document its own packages. You can find a list of packages in use [here](/gmcp)
