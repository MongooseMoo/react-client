# The `Char` package

## Char.Base

The 'char.base' set of data contains are items that will rarely change such as your class, subclass, race, clan, name. The char.base data is sent at login for scripts that want to capture this 'header' information and then not sent again unless one of these items changes.

``` json
char.base {
    "name": "Lasher",
    "class": "Warrior",
    "subclass": "Soldier",
    "race": "Elf",
    "clan": "wolf",
    "pretitle": "Testing",
    "perlevel": 1000
}
```

> Attention: The keys used in this command highly depend on the individual server.

## Char.Name

This message is sent by the server

``` json
Char.Name {
    "name": "Olad",
    "fullname": "Neophyte Olad"
}
```

## Char.Vitals

Sent by the server to inform the client of health, mana and moves information.

> Attention: The keys used in this command highly depend on the individual server.

Example from Aardwolf

``` json
char.vitals { 
    "hp": 100000, 
    "mana": 90000, 
    "moves": 41599 
}
```

Example from Starmourn

``` json
Char.Vitals { 
    "hp": "350", 
    "maxhp": "350", 
    "mp": "350", 
    "maxmp": "350", 
    "ep": "600", 
    "maxep": "600", 
    "wp": "600", 
    "maxwp": "600", 
    "nl": "0", 
    "bal": "1", 
    "eq": "1", 
    "vote": "1", 
    "string": "H:350/350 M:350/350 E:600/600 W:600/600 NL:0/100 ", 
    "charstats": [ "Bleed: 0", "Rage: 0" ] 
}
```

**Noteworthy**

- Some servers send (e.g. IRE serves) vitals as strings containing numbers, while others use integer datatypes.
- There is no common ground for a minimum set of vitals
