# The `Char.Login` package

Source: [Mudlet Wiki](https://wiki.mudlet.org/w/Standards:GMCP_Authentication)

This document defines a new GMCP extension to enable MUD clients to send credentials and perform authentication using GMCP messages instead of in-band login commands. It also includes optional support for OAuth authorization flows.

## Rationale

Different MUDs have diverse login command formats, making it challenging for MUD clients to handle login consistently. This extension provides a standardized way to exchange authentication information through GMCP, simplifying client development and improving compatibility. Additionally, the extension supports OAuth authorization flows, allowing clients to leverage external identity providers for login.

## Design

The extension introduces a new namespace called `Char.Login` with the following commands:

### Server-side

#### Char.Login.Default

Sent in response to `Client.Supports.Set`, or as soon as telnet negotiation completes, it informs the client of the supported authentication methods:

- `type` (array of strings, required): indicates the supported method(s), which is one or more of:
  - `password-credentials`: traditional username/password login.
  - `oauth`: OAuth-based login.
- `location` (string, required if `type` is `oauth`): openid-configuration location. See [https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html)

Since multiple flows can be supported by a server, the `type` array shall be ordered in the descending order of preference by the server. For example, if the server supports only the credentials flow:

``` text
 Char.Login.Default {"type": ["password-credentials"]}
```

If the server supports both OAuth and credentials and prefers OAuth:

``` text
 Char.Login.Default {"type": ["oauth", "password-credentials"], "location": "https://example.com/.well-known/openid-configuration" }
```

#### Char.Login.Result

Sent in response to `Char.Login.Credentials`, it informs the client of the success or failure of the credentials-based login.

- `success`: (boolean, required) Indicates whether the authentication attempt was successful. Can be a string value for compatibility with aged MUD drivers.
- `message`: (string, required if `success` is false) required string if the login wasn't successful: a human-readable message explaining the result, such as "Invalid credentials" or "Character not found".

### Client-side

#### Char.Login.Credentials

After receiving `Char.Login.Default` with `type` as `password-credentials`, the client sends the character name and password for traditional login.

- `account` (string, required): character name or the player account name. For games that implement both player and character names, the character name can be included after a colon (:), for example `myaccount:mycharacter`.
- `password` (string, required): character password. Servers are encouraged to implement [TLS over telnet](https://wiki.mudlet.org/w/Manual:Supported_Protocols#Secure_connection_.28TLS.29) to allow secure transmission of passwords.

In case the client does not know both the character name and password, it shall notify the server of this by sending an empty response. This can be used a response to any authentication method:

``` text
Char.Login.Credentials {}
```

**Example Flow (Password Credentials):**

1.  Client connects and sends: `Core.Supports.Set ["Char.Login 1", ...]`
2.  Server responds with: `Char.Login.Default {"type": ["password-credentials"]}`
3.  Client sends: `Char.Login.Credentials {"account": "username", "password": "password"}`
4.  Server validates credentials and performs login.

Example password flow ([source](https://gist.github.com/vadi2/6fcc05500823122143a5d45c43915ff0))

**OAuth Flows**

Specific details for the OAuth flow will be detailed once it is worked out with the community.

## Implementation Considerations

- This extension should be implemented according to the GMCP protocol specifications.
- Messages should be well-formatted JSON objects.
- Servers should validate incoming authentication information securely.
- Clients should handle potential errors and server responses gracefully.

## Conclusion

This GMCP extension provides a standardized and flexible approach to MUD client authentication, improving compatibility and enabling support for OAuth authorization flows. By adopting this extension, MUD developers and client developers can simplify login processes and enhance user experience.

**Note:** This is a draft proposal, and further community input and refinement may be necessary before finalizing the specification. Additionally, the specific details of OAuth flow support require input from the community to be defined.
